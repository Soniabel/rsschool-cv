### Profile

I am a simple girl, but I have one difference: **ambition!** I want to try something new every time. So,I do it! 

### Skills

I know such programming languages: *C++,HTML,CSS,JavaScript and C#*. To addaition, I know how to use different usfull programms.
One example of my code:
```
const customName = document.getElementById('customname');
const randomize = document.querySelector('.randomize');
const story = document.querySelector('.story');

function randomValueFromArray(array){
  const random = Math.floor(Math.random()*array.length);
  return array[random];
}
let storyText = "It was 94 fahrenheit outside, so :insertx: went for a walk. When they got to :inserty:, they stared in horror for a few moments, then :insertz:. Bob saw the whole thing, but was not surprised â€” :insertx: weighs 300 pounds, and it was a hot day.";
let insertX = ["Willy the Goblin",
"Big Daddy",
"Father Christmas"];
let insertY = ["the soup kitchen",
"Disneyland",
"the White House"];
let insertZ = ["spontaneously combusted",
"melted into a puddle on the sidewalk",
"turned into a slug and crawled away"];

randomize.addEventListener('click', result);

function result() {

  if(customName.value !== '') {
    let name = customName.value;

  }

  if(document.getElementById("uk").checked) {
    let weight = Math.round(300);
    let temperature =  Math.round(94);

  }

  story.textContent = ;
  story.style.visibility = 'visible';
  let newStory = storyText;
  let xItem = randomValueFromArray(insertX);
  let yItem = randomValueFromArray(insertY);
  let zItem = randomValueFromArray(insertZ);
}

```

### Work Experience

### Education
